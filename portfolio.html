            <h2>Softskills</h2>
            <p>"Softskills are more to do with who we are than what we know" - Marcel M. Robles.</p>
            <p>Skills are personal attributes that influence how well you can work or interact with others. These skills make it easier to form relationships with people, create trust and dependability, and lead teams. Throughout my Softskill sessions at VIT, I developed and improved my soft skills. Here I listed down my sofskills.</p>
